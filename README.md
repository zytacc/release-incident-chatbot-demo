# üõ†Ô∏è Release Incident Chatbot

A lightweight AI-powered assistant that helps engineering teams search and summarize historical production incident records using natural language.
Built by Elton Zhang as a personal learning project to explore applied AI in incident management and DevOps tooling.

## üß† What It Does

This chatbot allows you to:
- Query past production release incidents using **natural language**
- Filter by **date**, **month**, **issue owner**, or **relative timeframes**
- Summarize matching incidents using **OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo**
- Surface root causes and resolution patterns across deployments

Example queries:
- `"What incidents occurred in June?"`
- `"What did the release team handle last quarter?"`
- `"How many issues happened on 2025-03-24?"`
- `"Any QA incidents this month?"`

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Incidents are embedded using `sentence-transformers` and stored in a FAISS vector index.
2. User queries are semantically matched against the index.
3. Matching incidents are passed to OpenAI‚Äôs chat model for summarization or analysis.
4. Responses are shown alongside the retrieved logs for transparency.
